// Central place for reading/writing extension settings and the API key.
//
// A NOTE ON "SECURE STORAGE":
// Chrome extensions don't have access to the OS keychain, so there is no
// way to get true encryption-at-rest for a key from inside an extension.
// What we *can* guarantee:
//   - chrome.storage.local is isolated per-extension. Web pages (including
//     Splose itself) cannot read it, and other extensions cannot read it.
//   - It never touches source control, sync servers, or the page DOM.
//   - It is not chrome.storage.sync, so the key never leaves the machine.
// That's the realistic ceiling for a pure browser extension. If you need
// stronger guarantees later (e.g. per-clinician keys with central
// revocation), that points towards a small backing service issuing
// short-lived tokens rather than anything doable purely client-side.
//
// We default to chrome.storage.local (survives browser restarts, so
// reception doesn't have to re-enter the key every morning). If you'd
// rather the key only live in memory for the session, flip
// PERSIST_API_KEY to false and it will use chrome.storage.session instead.
